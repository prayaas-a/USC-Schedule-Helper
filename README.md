# USC Schedule Helper

This is a fork of USC Schedule Helper, originally a Chrome extension. I will port it to other browsers here.

## Note from original developer

The Schedule Helper relies heavily on globals, and isn't particularly good at handling failure. I'm making this code public so that someone can take over/fix possible problems after it becomes abandonware. If you have any questions about how it works, feel free to reach out - I've tried to make up for the beginner mistakes with a substantial amount of comments, but it's still fairly lacking.
